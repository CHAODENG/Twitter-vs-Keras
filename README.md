#### [Twitter Standard v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1)
**Some Available Endpoint:**
Tweets  | Users| Direct Messages| Trends| Geo|
--------- | --------| -------| --------| --------|
Post, retrieve, and engage with Tweets  | 	Manage account settings and profile | Sending and receiving events | 	Get trends near a location | 	Get information about a place
Get Tweet timelines  | Mute, block, and report users | Welcome Messages | Get locations with trending topics | Get places near a location
Search Tweets: 7 day*  | Follow, search, and get users | Quick Replies |
Curate a collection of Tweets | Create and manage lists | Conversation management |
___
#### [Twitter Premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium)
The premium Search Tweets offering provides access to the past 30 days of Twitter data or to the full history of Twitter data dependent on the endpoint selected.

These endpoints provide functionality beyond whatâ€™s available in our standard search endpoint, including:

    1. More Tweets per request
    2. Higher rate limits
    3. A counts endpoint that returns time-series counts of Tweets (only available at paid tiers)
    4. More complex querying tools
    5. Metadata enrichments, such as expanded URLs and improved profile geo information

#### [Twitter Enterprise](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise)

The Twitter enterprise APIs offer the highest level of access and reliability to those who depend on Twitter data. Perfect as you scale beyond premium and need more reliable access, custom tailored packages, or longer-term contracts. Enterprise API access comes with dedicated account managers and personalized technical support.

### [Keras API](https://keras.io/)

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.  

Keras is:
* **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
* **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.
* **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
